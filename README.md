# Heart-rate-detection-using-webcam
A computer vision project that calculates heart rate (BPM) from a webcam. Uses Python, OpenCV, cvzone, and NumPy to perform Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) and FFT analysis on a detected face, tracking blood-flow pulses. Includes a live plot and a Tkinter GUI for controls.
